      <p>I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. I never know why. I only know who. Come along, Pond! Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey?</p>
      <p>Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey? Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. I never know why. I only know who. Geronimo! There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good!</p>
      <p>Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings!</p>
