Well, it's been a few.

Last time I attempted the blogging thing *five years ago*, I had just learned how to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) for dependency management.
After years of writing horrible spaghetti code I turned to frameworks, [Laravel](https://laravel.com) being my favorite.

I've also since befriended JavaScript. It should be no surprise as a Laravel fan that I prefer [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).
I learned JS in the days when jQuery was used by everyone, everywhere.

My current projects include:

- Client site on [Statamic](https://statamic.com)
- Frontend for [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) built with Laravel & [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com)
- Markdown editor built on top of [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev) with [Electron](https://electronjs.org) , thanks to [Desktop Apps with Electron](https://beyondco.de/video-courses/desktop-apps-with-electron)
