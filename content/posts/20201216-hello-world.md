Well, it's been a few.

To recap, last time I attempted the blogging thing *five years ago*, I had just learned how to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) for dependency management. Since then I've become well acquainted with the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) ecosystem.

I've also since reluctantly befriended JavaScript. It should be no surprise as a Laravel fan that I prefer [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). I learned JS in the days when jQuery was used by everyone, everywhere.

My current projects include:

- Personal/lifestyle blog on [Statamic](https://statamic.com)
- Frontend for [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) built with Laravel & [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com) <small class="text-gray-500 text-lg">– considering a pure Nuxt.js build</small>
- Markdown editor built on top of [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev) with [Electron](https://electronjs.org), thanks to [Desktop Apps with Electron](https://beyondco.de/video-courses/desktop-apps-with-electron) <small class="text-gray-500 text-lg">– mostly for fun/learning but if it turns out to be something useful I'll open source it</small>

This site should be considered a work in progress... I wrote it in about a day. I originally built it in Statamic but it felt like overkill for a static site. After the site grows I plan to switch back.
